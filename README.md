# MAML-and-FOMAML-implimentaion-and-comparison
It is just an implementation of Model Agnostic Meta learning and First order approximation of it using learn2learn library in Pytorch on Omniglot dataset.


#### Dependencies

Use the following command

```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio matplotlib learn2learn scipy
```

To open the ipynb file you would need jupyter notebook

```
pip install jupyter notebook
```

If you have a GPU please use the code as it is

If you don't have a GPU installed

Change the following flag in the ipynb file

```
cuda=False
```

##### That's it the code should work on your system

This code also times the execution time using time library and the jupyter code as been run for 10000 steps, if you are intrested in seeing the difference and learning more about the MAML amd FOMAML.
